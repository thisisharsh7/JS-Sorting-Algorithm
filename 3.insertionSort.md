# Insertion sort

Although the code implementation of insertion sort is not as simple and rude as bubble sort and selection sort, its principle should be the easiest to understand, because anyone who has played poker should be able to understand it in seconds. Insertion sort is one of the simplest and most intuitive sorting algorithms. Its working principle is to construct an ordered sequence. For unsorted data, scan from back to front in the sorted sequence, find the corresponding position and insert it.

Insertion sort, like bubble sort, also has an optimization algorithm called split-half insertion.


## 1. Algorithm steps

1. Treat the first element of the first to-be-sorted sequence as an ordered sequence, and treat the second to last element as an unsorted sequence.

2. Scan the unsorted sequence from the beginning to the end, and insert each element scanned into the appropriate position of the sorted sequence. (If the element to be inserted is equal to an element in the ordered sequence, the element to be inserted is inserted after the equal element.)

## 3. JavaScript code implementation

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
    var len = arr.length;
    var preIndex, current;
    for (var i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        preIndex = i - 1;
        current = arr[i];
        while(preIndex >= 0 && arr[preIndex] > current) {
            arr[preIndex+1] = arr[preIndex];
            preIndex--;
        }
        arr[preIndex+1] = current;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

## 4. Python Code 

```python
def insertionSort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        preIndex = i-1
        current = arr[i]
        while preIndex >= 0 and arr[preIndex] > current:
            arr[preIndex+1] = arr[preIndex]
            preIndex-=1
        arr[preIndex+1] = current
    return arr
```

## 5. Go Code
```go
func insertionSort(arr []int) []int {
	for i := range arr {
		preIndex := i - 1
		current := arr[i]
		for preIndex >= 0 && arr[preIndex] > current {
			arr[preIndex+1] = arr[preIndex]
			preIndex -= 1
		}
		arr[preIndex+1] = current
	}
	return arr
}
```

## 6. Java code implementation

````java
public class InsertSort implements IArraySort {

    @Override
    public int[] sort(int[] sourceArray) throws Exception {
        // Copy arr without changing the parameter content
        int[] arr = Arrays.copyOf(sourceArray, sourceArray.length);

        // Select the appropriate position to insert from the element with subscript 1, because there is only one element with subscript 0, the default is ordered
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {

            // record the data to be inserted
            int tmp = arr[i];

            // Compare from the rightmost of the sorted sequence and find the number smaller than it
            int j = i;
            while (j > 0 && tmp < arr[j - 1]) {
                arr[j] = arr[j - 1];
                j--;
            }

            // there is a smaller number, insert
            if (j != i) {
                arr[j] = tmp;
            }

        }
        return arr;
    }
}
````

## 7. PHP code implementation

```php
function insertionSort($arr)
{
    $len = count($arr);
    for ($i = 1; $i < $len; $i++) {
        $preIndex = $i - 1;
        $current = $arr[$i];
        while($preIndex >= 0 && $arr[$preIndex] > $current) {
            $arr[$preIndex+1] = $arr[$preIndex];
            $preIndex--;
        }
        $arr[$preIndex+1] = $current;
    }
    return $arr;
}
```
